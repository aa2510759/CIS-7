- [ ]  Prove:  If n = 25, 100, or 169, then n is a perfect square and is the sum of two perfect squares.  
       Indicate which method of proof you used.
        
        sqrt(n) = perfect square
        if n = integer
        
        given n = 25   given n = 100   given n = 169
        sqrt(25) = 5    sqrt(100) = 10  sqrt(169) = 13
    
       
  
- [ ]  Prove:  The sum of two odd integers is even. 
       Hint: By definition, even integers can be expressed as 2n, thus odd integers can be expressed as 2n + 1	
       
       given even = 2n and odd = 2n + 1
       
       if n = 1
       (2(n)+ 1) + (2(n)+ 1) = sum of odd integers
       then (2(1)+ 1) + (2(1)+ 1)
       sum of odd integers = 6
       sum of odd integers is even
       
       
       
- [ ]  Prove:  The sum of an even integer and it's square is even

      given even integers can be expressed as 2n
      
      if n = 1
      2n + 2n = sum of even integers
      2(1) + 2(1) = 4
      sum of even integer is even
      
      if n = 1
      (2(n))^2 = even integer squared
      (2(1))^2 = 4
      even integer squared is even
      
      
- [ ]  Prove by Contradiction: If n squared is odd, then n is odd
      
      if n squared is not odd, then n is not odd
      
      if n = 2
      
      (2(n) + 1)^2 = n squared is not odd
      (2(2) + 1)^2 = 25
      
      n is odd but n squared is not odd 
      Therefore if n squared is odd then n is odd
